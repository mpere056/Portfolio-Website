name: "Discord Multiplayer Sudoku Activity"
year: "2025"
headline: "First real-time collaborative Sudoku built with Discord Activities"
summary: "React-powered Activity that lets multiple users solve the same puzzle inside Discord, with secure game-state storage via Vercel proxy."
more-info:
  - "Not many people know how to create a Discord Activity, and I didn't either."
  - "One day, I played a Sudoku Discord activity with a friend, but we weren't able to solve the same puzzle together."
  - "That gave me the incentive to learn to create Discord Activities to make this multiplayer Sudoku Activity."
  - "Discord Activities operate within a secure iframe, which prevents direct connections to external services like databases. To overcome this, I use a robust solution: all data persistence for multiplayer game states is securely routed through a Vercel serverless proxy API. This ensures seamless communication with a Supabase backend while adhering to Discord's security policies."

headline: "Multi-bot relay that bypasses rate limits and animates text at ~20 FPS"
summary: "Orchestrates bots to send and delete messages in a strict sequence, creating high-frame-rate text animations."
more-info:
  - "You can basically overcome Discord's rate limit using this system, by sending messages through many different bots instead of all on one account."
  - "So if all of the bots have the same name and profile picture, you can achieve an illusion of playing a video in the chat that's constructed out of text."
  - "It could play videos at 20 FPS if you had 20 bots, which is pretty cool."

Each bot posts one frame then deletes it as the next bot posts; identical names and avatars make the swap invisible to users.

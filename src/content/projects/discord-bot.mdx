headline: "Early natural-language role manager with message & webpage screenshotter"
summary: "Python 3 bot that automated screenshots via Selenium and parsed plain-English commands to manage roles."
more-info:
  - "I made many Discord bots over the years but this was one of my first ones."
  - "The most interesting feature is it was able to screenshot messages. This was possible through using Selenium, so the bot would have Discord open on its own browser. It would screenshot the page, then find the element information for the specified message, and use that information to crop the screenshot of the page to just the specified message."
  - "The bot also attempted to understand natural language commands, so you could say 'give David the role verified' and it would look for a user named David and assign them the role verified. I achieved this without using AI (this was in 2016), just through having the bot analyze the syntax of a sentence, and look for certain keywords like 'give' and 'role'."

Commands like `give David the role verified` worked  without LLMsâ€”just string parsing and clever keyword weighting.

Friends from AoTTG moved to Discord, and I followed, immediately experimenting with Discord bots. 

School remained straightforward: I usually finished homework during class or lunch, so evenings stayed free for me to play games with friends and do some programming.

My grades were exemplary, so I got accepted into all the universities I applied to, and decided to go to the University of Ottawa.

Friends from AoTTG moved to Discord, and I followed, immediately experimenting with the newly released bot API.  
School remained straightforward: I finished homework during class, lunch, or during breaks, so evenings stayed free.  
My grades were exemplary, so I got accepted into all the universities I applied to, and decided to go to the University of Ottawa.

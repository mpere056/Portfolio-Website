I started posting invite links on forums like 4chan and in YouTube comments.

Discord was new at this time and very few other people advertised their Discord server in this way, so there was little to no regulation for this on these platforms.

It was effective, adding around 100 members a day, but manual and time-consuming.

Brainstorming new methods of outreach, a friend and I coded a bot that DM-invited users. 

Discord had no anti-bot defences yet, so this was a game changer. 

Joins shot up to ~500 per day, and almost as many leaving the server everyday.

But within a few months, we grew the server up to 26,000 members.

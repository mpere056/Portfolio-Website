Upon requesting to resume my Computer Science degree at the University of Ottawa, I learned that I had been removed from the program.

Getting back into the program required taking eight courses.

There were a LOT of setbacks during these two years (ask my AI about it!).

I re-entered the Computer Science program and earned my degree in 2024.

During my final semester, I started working at AirOps, building AI workflows and Python/JavaScript tools.

Upon requesting to resume my Computer Science degree at the University of Ottawa, I learned that I had been removed from the program.
Getting back into the program required eight courses; I completed them, re-entered Computer Science and earned the degree in 2024.  
During my final semester, I started working at AirOps, building prompt systems and Python/JavaScript tools.

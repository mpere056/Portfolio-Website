During my Little Big Planet 2 gaming period, I also got into Modern Warfare 2.

At first I just played it like anyone else, and got pretty good at quickscoping. 

But about a year into the game, I found out about modding.

I never wrote a single MW2 mod, but I learned how to flash firmware, load patched files, and share the chaos with friends and strangers.

Seeing hundreds of players enjoy rule-bending lobbies that I hosted was really cool.

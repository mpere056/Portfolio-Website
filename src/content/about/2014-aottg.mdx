I first started playing an indie game called Attack on Titan Tribute Game in 2013.

Around the end of the school semester with my C++ course, I found out that the Unity games could be modded through using .NET decompilers like DNSpy.

Now realizing the entire game was editable, this opened up a whole new playground for me.

I first built mods just for myself, then discovered that sharing the same modified DLL with others enabled the possibility of multiplayer mods.  

That led me to learn the basics of RPC calls and network sync.  

A modders Skype group for the game formed; I helped it grow, and discovered my love for community management.

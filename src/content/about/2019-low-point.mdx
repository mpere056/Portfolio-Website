Although that server experience was amazing, I made a lot of bad decisions in my life during that period. 
I would skip class more and more, my grades in university progressively got worse and worse. 
I started isolating myself from my non online friends more and more and payed less and less attention to my mental health. 
I stopped attending university, hid academic failures and my online life from family and others around me, started using substances to escape, and sunk into guilt and depression.
This ultimately culminated at the end of 2019, the lowest point in my life.
Something needed to change.
I didn't know what to do, but I couldn't keep going in this direction.
Long solitary walks - home to campus and back - became silent therapy as I searched for a way forward.

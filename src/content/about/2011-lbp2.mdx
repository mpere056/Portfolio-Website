Little Big Planet 2 came out when I was 14 and rewired how I interacted with games.

Its level-creator exposed AND, OR and XOR gates.

Among many things, I built a multi-button lock that required simultaneous inputs and a chained sequence to open.  

No tutorials, just curious experimentation.

Without realising it, I was learning programming fundamentals while feeling like I was playing.

Little Big Planet 2 arrived when I was fourteen and rewired how I interacted with games.  
Its level-creator exposed AND, OR and XOR gates.
Among many things, I built a multi-button lock that required simultaneous inputs and a chained sequence to open.  
With no tutorials, just curious experimentation.
Without realising it, I was learning programming fundamentals while feeling like I was playing.

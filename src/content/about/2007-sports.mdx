When I was about five, I played hockey with the Ottawa Cougars.

I got into Taekwondo shortly afterwards, and continued until I was about 10 and was granted a black belt.

I also started swimming at a young age, and achieved a bronze medallion when I was about 12. 

Soccer was something I played casually at school during recess.

I played squash competitively for a few years from the age of about 10 to 13, winning a bronze at a local tournament I took place in.

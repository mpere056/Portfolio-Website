Working on this app has been an interesting journey, with unexpected ups and downs.
When doing research for research backed frameworks to use in the app, I came upon the "Designing Your Life" framework developed by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans from Stanford.
I reached out to them about potentially working together, and after many emails back and forth and a Zoom call, they gave me an offer of $100k to develop and launch the app.
For various reasons around the terms of the offer, I decided not to take it and have pivoted the app since then to be able to accommodate multiple frameworks rather than being tied down to one.
This has been one of the most technically challenging projects I've worked on in my life, which I believe will be worth it once it all comes together.

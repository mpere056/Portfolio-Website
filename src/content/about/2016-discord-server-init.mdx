In 2016, I joined a Discord server someone online I didn't know invited me to, to play Black Desert together.
The server owner dreamed of a lively, anarchy type community where people could freely express themselves.  
Inspired by his vision, I started exploring ways to help it grow, unaware of the scale that lay ahead.
We never ended up playing Black Desert together.

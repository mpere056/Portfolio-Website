Because of our desired anarachical nature to the server, the content that was posted was sometimes extreme and needed moderation to ensure Discord TOS wasn't violated.  
We organised moderators into a five-tier hierarchy and maintained 24/7 coverage.  
We were able to have this dedicated team because people really loved the server, no one asked for money for their energy investment, they saw it as a badge of prestige to move up the hierarchy. 
Analytics showed ~25 000 messages daily.  
The experience taught me how to grow a community, how to foster an active and engaging environment, and governance.

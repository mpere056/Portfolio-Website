Learning to print text to the console, clear the screen, take inputs, and use if statements was enough to make my first Tic-Tac-Toe game.
By term-end I created a tiny command-line platformer that could jump and shoot, and where I used `=` characters to form a kamehameha beam.  
This felt like playing Little Big Planet 2 again, except now I was working with real code.

Hours before and after school were poured into scales, études and theory drills.
I would often practice for 5 hours a day, sometimes more.  
By the end of 2009, every performance exam was finished; finishing up the theory and paperwork made it official by 2012.
The discipline I learned at the piano still guides every project I tackle.

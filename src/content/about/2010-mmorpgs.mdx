Twelve-year-old me spent nights and weekends grinding quests and talking to online friends, later adding them on MSN and Skype.  
A friend showed me how their Maple Story private server changed NPC dialogue and EXP rates.  
I understood almost none of the technical details, but the seed was planted: games were *made* by people - and their code could be changed.

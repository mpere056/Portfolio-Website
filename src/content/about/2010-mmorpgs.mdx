Twelve-year-old me spent nights and weekends grinding quests and talking to online friends, later adding them on MSN and Skype.  

Around this time, a friend showed me their Maple Story private server and how it changed NPC dialogues and EXP rates.  

I understood almost none of the technical details, but the seed was planted: games were *made* by people - and their code could be changed.

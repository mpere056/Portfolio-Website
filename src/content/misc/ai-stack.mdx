headline: "Supabase pgvector retrieval + Gemini streaming on Vercel Edge"
summary: "RAG pipeline that embeds MDX content, retrieves similar chunks from Supabase, and streams answers from Gemini with citations."

The chatbot loads content from my MDX files (projects and timeline), converts it to plain text, chunks it, and stores vector embeddings in Supabase using `pgvector`.

At query time, it embeds your question, retrieves the most similar chunks via an RPC (`match_docs`), selects a diverse subset, and sends that context to Gemini 2.5 Flash. Responses stream to the UI and include citations like `(story-app)` when relevant.

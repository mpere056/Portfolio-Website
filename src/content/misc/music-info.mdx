I started playing the piano when I was 4 years old.
I was clasically trained through the Royal Conservatory of Music.
After receiving the ARCT in piano performance, I was very good at performing music that I practiced.
But after that, I realized there was still a LOT more for me to learn.
For example, I wasn't able to play the piano by ear, not even very simple songs with just 3-4 alternating chords.
If I had the sheet music, I could sight read most basic songs and play them well on my first play through.
But I didn't know how to compose new music to express myself.
And this has been my main focus over the last 15 years, learning to really feel what I play and play what I feel.

I currently mostly play the piano for church services on Sundays and Saturdays. 
I also occasionally play for private events like funerals and concerts.

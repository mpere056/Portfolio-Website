In 2022, upon requesting to resume my Computer Science degree at the University of Ottawa, I learned that I had been removed from the program.
Getting back into the program required taking eight courses.
Just being able to take these eight courses was a challenge, because I was given a status as a special (non-degree) student.
As a special student, I was only allowed to take a maximum of two courses per semester.
This meant it would take me four semesters (a year and a half!) just to complete the eight courses to get back into the program.
After a lot of back and forth with the university administration, I was granted permission to take four courses a semester.
I had to submit an application into the Computer Science program after completing the eight courses.
But after completing the eight courses, I was past the program registration deadline for that year, meaning I would need to wait a whole year to get back into Computer Science.
In addition to that, my grades from when I had previously studied at the university were very low due to my bad decisions.
So my chances of getting into the course even after applying were low.
But after a lot more back and forth with multiple different sections of the university administration, they made another exception for me and submitted my application even though it was past the due date.
And then, fortunately for me, the higher ups decided to allow me back into the program to give me a second chance.
You might think this was the end of my struggles and that it was smooth sailing from here.
But no, there were a LOT more challenges to overcome to get this degree.
First of all, I had to take about 12 courses + do an honours project to finish the degree.
To be considered a full time student, students need to take 4 courses a semester, which is a pretty normal course load.
But I had already spent 2 semesters taking the eight courses to get back into my program, I didn't want to study for another 3 whole semesters + honours project to finish the program.
So I took 6 courses during the fall semester, 6 courses in the winter semester, and did the honours project during the summer.
The heavy courseload was challenging, but this wasn't the only difficulty.
I wasn't able to schedule all six courses within each semester because of university course timing conflicts.
But I didn't want to delay things any further.
So I looked into other universities.
In my fall semester, I took four courses with the University of Ottawa, one course with Carleton University, and one course with Athabasca University.
It was difficult to coordinate everything between these three universities, but I got through it.
The winter semester was even more difficult to coordinate.
There was one course I needed to take - CSI 3120 - that wasn't offered by any university in Ottawa or remotely in any university in Canada during the Winter semester that wouldn't conflict with the timing of my other courses.
So I looked into universities in other countries.
I found three universities in China that offered this course, but unlike with Carleton University or Athabasca University, my university wasn't well aware of the procedures in interacting with those three Chinese universities.
So it was up to me to figure this out on my own.
I called each of the universities.
Didn't have any luck with two of them, but Soochow University said they would be able to offer me the course I needed.
Though it was not a straightforward process at all.
The initial person I spoke to on the phone transferred me to someone else that speaks better English to help me. That person didn't have the information I needed, but they said they'll ask someone from Canada to call me.
A day or so later, I received a call from someone in Toronto saying they're associated with Soochow. They also didn't have the information I needed, but they gave me an email to write to.
I wrote to that email, and they gave me another email to reach out to.
So I wrote to that other email, and finally I had someone in China that was able to help me.
The second email correspondent helped me get registered for the course, however there was yet ANOTHER problem - payment.
Payment was normally done through WeChat Pay or other Chinese services, which I wasn't signed up with.
So they gave me a third party that's not officially from Soochow University, with a Canadian bank account for me to send the payment to.
This sounded very sketchy to me, I was so far down the line away from speaking to official university staff, I didn't know if I should proceed.
I asked my university what to do, and they said they actually didn't know, because they never had a student try to pay Soochow University with a Canadian bank account before.
I took the leap of faith and sent over the money.
Not knowing if I was a part of a huge fraud system, a few months later I finished the course, and thankfully they sent over the required information to my university and I got the credits I needed.
With 12 courses done, now I just needed to finish my honours project, easy, simple.
Except it wasn't.
My university usually doesn't offer the honours project in the summer semester, they only offer it on an exceptions basis.
I spoke with the staff in charge of the department, and they said they were willing to make an exception for me, but I had to find two professors that were willing to take on this course with me during the summer.
Thankfully, I found two willing professors, and the directory of the honours project program approved me to do the course during the summer.
It was mostly smooth sailing from here, with a couple last hiccups.
I finished the course by the end of June, but one professor went on vacation without giving me notice in advance.
Anxiously awaiting a response from them, I heard back from them a few weeks later, and they graded my course.
But the second professor was now not responding. The deadline for the course was in August, and as I approached the deadline, still no response.
Now the day before the deadline, I reached out to the program director informing them of my strange situation.
Thankfully, they found for me a new professor that was willing to finish things out for me, and I was able to finish my honours project.
And with that, I was able to graduate with a degree in Computer Science from the University of Ottawa.

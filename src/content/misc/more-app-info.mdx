This journey actually started more around 2020, but 2023 is when I created my first app.
During my time in kitchener when I was trying to figure things out, I was questioning everything and trying to find my way.
This is when I had profound realizations that you can change the direction of your life. 
And it's possible to work towards making your dream life a reality.
Once I had that realization, I also realized that many people around me didn't seem to realize this.
So I started trying to think about how I can help people with this.
Then in 2022, after I had moved back to Ottawa, I had a conversation with an old school friend that I hadn't seen in over a decade.
During this conversation, I asked him what his dream life would look like.
At first he said the usual generic answers like he would want to be rich and travel.
But beyond that, he found it surprisingly difficult to think about what else his dream life would look like.
This planted the seed in my mind that people need help with imagining their dream life.
In 2022, I started working on the story generation app. 
It started off just as a project for me to improve my app development skills, and to learn how to use AI APIs.
But then one day while using the internet, I saw that someone had created an AI grant.
So I looked into applying for this, and I had to make a pitch deck to apply for it.
I made a pitch deck for my story app, and began to think more about a long term vision for the app.
This is when I had the idea that this app could actually help people with figuring out what their dream life would look like.
So I put that into my pitch deck and applied, but didn't get the grant.
My app vision wasn't well thought out, I just put together the pitch deck in the moment, and I wasn't expecting much out of it.
And I stopped working on the story app after that to focus more on finishing my university bachelor's degree.
I never got back to the story app.
But over the next year or so, this idea of helping people with working towards their dream life kept ruminating in the back of my mind, and I really wanted to create a product to help in this way.
So in 2025, I started working on my new app, the life app.
To make sure I was using effective techniques in the app to help people, I did some research on life help frameworks.
I came upon Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans.
I decided that I would reach out to them to see if anything could come out of that.
I bought their book, watched some of their content online, then sent a personalized email to both of them.
They responded, and we exchanged a few emails back and forth.
Then they told me to reach out again once I had a working app.
So I put my head down and worked on this.
Then a few months later, I had a working app, made a demo of it, and reached out to them again.
They liked the demo, and after hopping on a call with them, they sent me a $100k offer to fund the full commercial development of the app.

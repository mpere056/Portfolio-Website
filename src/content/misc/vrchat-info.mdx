In 2017-2018, I made mods, along with a few of my friends, for the Unity game VRChat.
My friends really enjoyed looking for vulnerabilities and exploits within the game.
I enjoyed using exploits they found to make cool things.
One of the things they found was a way to manipulate the transforms of objects, in a way that everyone in the server would see the effect of so it wasn't just a local change.
Transforms control rotation, scale, and position of an object.
So using this exploit, I created a portal mode, where I designated two objects as portals, and any object or person's avatar that touched one object would get teleported to the other object.
I also created an interface that allowed me to modify parts of a person's avatar in real time in the game, which people found to be very entertaining.

Another cool thing we did on VRChat was our involvement with VRChat "gangs". 
There were groups of people in the game that got a hold of techniques to crash other people in the game through loading in avatars that were too big for the game to handle, in turn crashing people.
They would put these "crasher avatars" into objects like guns and swords, and acted like gang members, crashing people that didn't give them the attention they wanted.
These crasher avatars could be completely avoided by turning off shaders and other settings in the VRChat settings.
My friends created their own crashes, but ones made through code that couldn't be avoided through changing any settings in the game.
We made a bot that would quickly join and leave every public server in the game.
We weren't part of these abusive VRChat gangs, but we put together a list of VRChat gang members that were being abusive in the community.
And if you were on our list, you effectively couldn't play the game in a public server, because our bot would join your server and crash you, and crash just that one person and not the entire server.

Everything we did here was against the game's TOS, but we eventually developed good relations with the game's developers, and even helped them fix a number of their vulnerabilities.
